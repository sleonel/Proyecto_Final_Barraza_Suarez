/**
 * Node L2. 
 * 
 * Every time a timer fires, this component sends a packet with this node ID 
 * and the packet's sequence number . This component is a TPSN request send to L1 node.
 * This node receive a report packet from L1 with  time stamp that it received the request. 
 * This component is fully wired and can be used by any application as an 
 * autonomous block.
